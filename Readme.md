Typed Koa with built-in router

## What is it

This is an experimental http server framework based on koa, it aims on adding type information to koa context.
However, to make this goal some additional changes need to be introduced.

- Built-in router: A stand-alone router won't inherits parameteried type information from koa app instance, while a router generated by app instance does.
- Built-in bodyparser: Actually we can just specialize request type by providing parameter type for request on context, but a customed bodyparser is included for the convience of fast prototyping.

## Know issues

- Both state and request type parameters are fields of context, so it's not easy to just change one of them, you can specify the first one and left the second one for default value but it can not be reversed. And this method only apply when putting type parameter on use method, it does not work for specifing only the first type of handler parameter.

This works:

```ts
router.use<STATE_TYPE>(ctx => {})
```

This works also:

```ts
router.use((ctx: Context<STATE_TYPE, REQUEST_TYPE>) => {})
```

This does not:

```ts
router.use((ctx: Context<STATE_TYPE>) => {}) // the request type would be come default of Request, if you change request type before, it would be lost.
```

## Usage

```ts
// default type param is {} other than any, so it is extendable
const app = new Application /*<{}>*/().use(async (ctx: Context<{ user: { id: string } }>, next) => {
  // get user from db
  // ctx.state.user = await getUser()
  return next()
})

const router1 = app
  .use(BodyParser()) // apply body parser to attach body field to ctx.request
  .createRouter('/route1')
router1
  // when need to extend context type, declare only what you want to attach
  .use<{ user: { name: string } }>((ctx, next) => {
    console.log(ctx.request.body) // access request body
    ctx.state.user.name = 'foo'
    return next()
  })
  // context type is by default according to last middleware
  .use((ctx, next) => {
    // ctx has a default type
    ctx.state.user.id = 'id'
    ctx.state.user.name = 'name'
    return next()
  })
  .get('/abc', ctx => {
    console.log(ctx.state.user.id)
    ctx.body = `hello, ${ctx.state.user.name}!`
  })
app.listen(3000)
```
